    mix-up) caused by a manual step nobody got to run:

      1. A database Alembic already manages (an alembic_version table
         exists) -> just apply any pending migrations. This is the normal
         case for every deploy from here on.
      2. A pre-existing database from before Flask-Migrate was introduced
         (this app's exact situation right now: tables exist via the old
         db.create_all()-only approach, no alembic_version table) -> patch
         known drift (columns added to a model after its table already
         existed, which create_all() can never retrofit), run create_all()
         as a final safety net (harmless/additive for existing tables), then
         stamp the database at the latest migration so Alembic's history
         lines up with reality — automatically, on this exact boot.
      3. A genuinely fresh/empty database -> let Alembic build it from
         scratch via the migration history.
